# MADDPG2017-pytorch

This is an almost line-by-line pytorch-version replication of OpenAI's official released codes for [Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG)](https://github.com/openai/maddpg), which are originally written in Tensorflow.

Most codes are borrowed from [OpenAI's SpinningUp tutorial](https://spinningup.openai.com/) .
